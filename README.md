### **For/Of Loops**
-   `for-of` loop which allows us to iterate over arrays or other iterable objects (e.g. strings).
-   The code inside the loop is executed for each element of the iterable object.

### **Map, Filter, and Reduce**

-   `map():` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
-   `filter():`method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
-   `reduce():`method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array from left to right to reduce it to a single value.

### **Objects**

-   `Objects` are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. 
-   An object can be created with figure brackets `{}` with an optional list of properties. 
-   A property is a key value pair, where key is a string also called a property name, and value can be anything.
